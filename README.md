# Analysing Jest test performance

## Introduction

The is an example project used for the purposes of a blog article to analyse and explain some of the reasons for Jest performance problems.

The project is based on a basic React app bootstrapped using the well-known [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) tool.

## Getting started

- Clone repository
- Install the dependencies: `npm install`
- Start an [ndb](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ndb) profiling session in a Chromium browser: `npm run profile`
- Then, in the scripts side bar under the sources tab, we can record profiling information for the
various npm scripts (which contain sample test cases) by clicking the ‚è∫ button next to those scripts.

## Test cases
1. `test1`: the benchmark test using the sample code and sample test generated by Create React App
2. `test2`: importing a [Material UI](https://mui.com/) button component from the package's barrel file
3. `test3`: importing a Material UI button component via a deep import
4. `test4`: using automocking to mock the Material UI component library
5. `test5`: using factory mocking to mock the Material UI component library
